Hi, my name is Justin Irving.
My career thus far has been in the civil/environmental engineering space
where I've focused a significant amount of my time on applying my interest in programming
and data science to water/wastewater related projects. This Git repository serves as a 
journal of my forays into a more data science role which goes beyond the environmental engineering field.
