Hi, my name is Justin Irving.
My career thus far has been in the civil/environmental engineering space
where I've applied data visualization and analytics techniques to a variety of 
water/wastewater projects. This Git repository serves as a 
journal of my forays into a more data science role which goes beyond the environmental engineering field.
